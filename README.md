Code for paper: IEEG-HCT A Hierarchical CNN-Transformer Combined Network for Intracranial EEG Signal Identification

The Multicenter iEEG dataset can be found [here](https://springernature.figshare.com/collections/Multicenter_intracranial_EEG_dataset_for_classification_of_graphoelements_and_artifactual_signals/4681208).

At this moment, we are actively using the dataset and codebase for ongoing research projects. We plan to release the full code once the subsequent research studies, which build upon this work, are published.
